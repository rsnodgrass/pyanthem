AVM 2 Serial Programming

The serial command set of the AVM 2 Version 1.11 software is documented below. The serial port is set to baud rate of 19,200, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit by default. These settings can be changed via the set-up menus (Menu 8 Triggers/IR/RS-232). Command lines must be terminated by an ASCII line feed (0x0a hexadecimal) and be no longer than 64 bytes (including the line feed terminator). For example, to turn the main zone on, send:

P1P1<lf>

where <lf> is an ASCII line feed. Multiple commands can be placed on a single command line if separated by a semicolon. For example, to turn the main zone on and switch to the tuner, and tune to FM pre-set 2 on FM pre-set bank 1 send:

P1P1;P1S4;TFP12<lf>

Command processing begins when the first semicolon separator or line feed terminator is received. If there is an error in the command an error message is sent back. If the command is successfully executed no response is sent back.

If Tx Status is set to â€™yesâ€™ in the set-up menus (Menu 8 Triggers/IR/RS-232 item i. Tx Status) all changes of state are sent by the AVM 2 on the serial port in the same format as the command set. This means that the AVM 2 will echo all serial, IR, front panel button and volume knob activity as well as changes of state due to changes in the input audio (eg. source bitstream change from DTS to Dolby Digital).
